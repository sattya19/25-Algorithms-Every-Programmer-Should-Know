/*
 * This Java program, named `BinarySearch`, allows a user to perform binary
 * search on a sorted array of integers to find a target element. Here's a
 * detailed description of the program's functionality:
 * 
 * 1. **Import Statements**: The program begins by importing two Java libraries:
 * `java.util.Arrays` and `java.util.Scanner`, which are used for array
 * manipulation and user input, respectively.
 * 
 * 2. **Binary Search Method (`binarySearch`)**:
 * - This method takes two parameters: an integer array `arr` and an integer
 * `target`.
 * - It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of
 * the array, respectively.
 * - It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or
 * equal to `right`, ensuring that the search space is not empty.
 * - Inside the loop:
 * - It calculates the middle index `mid` using the formula `mid = left + (right
 * - left) / 2`. This formula ensures that `mid` is always the midpoint of the
 * current search range.
 * - It checks if the element at the middle index, `arr[mid]`, is equal to the
 * `target`. If they are equal, it returns `mid`, indicating that the element
 * has been found.
 * - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, it means the `target` may be in the
 * right half of the array, so it updates `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the
 * right half.
 * - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, it means the `target` may be in the
 * left half of the array, so it updates `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the
 * left half.
 * - If the loop exits without finding the target element, the method returns
 * -1, indicating that the element was not found.
 * 
 * 3. **Main Method (`main`)**:
 * - The `main` method is the program's entry point.
 * - It creates a `Scanner` object, `sc`, to read user input.
 * - It prompts the user to enter the length of the sorted array and reads the
 * input into the variable `len`.
 * - It creates an integer array, `arr`, with a length of `len`, which will
 * store the sorted elements of the array.
 * - The program then prompts the user to enter the sorted elements of the array
 * one by one, and it stores them in the `arr` array.
 * - Next, the user is asked to enter the element they want to search for, and
 * the input is stored in the variable `target`.
 * - To ensure the array is sorted (a prerequisite for binary search), the
 * program uses `Arrays.sort(arr)` to sort it in ascending order.
 * - It calls the `binarySearch` method with the sorted array `arr` and the
 * target `target`, and stores the result in the variable `index`.
 * - Finally, it checks the value of `index` and prints whether the element was
 * found or not, along with its index if found.
 * 
 * 4. **Closing Scanner**: The program closes the `Scanner` object to release
 * resources when it's done with user input.
 * 
 * Overall, this program provides a user-friendly way to perform binary search
 * on a sorted array, helping users locate elements efficiently.

/*
 * The provided Java program is an implementation of the binary search
 * algorithm. Binary search is used to find a specific element in a sorted array
 * efficiently. Here's a description of the program:
 * 
 * Import Statements:
 * 
 * The program starts with importing two Java utility classes: java.util.Arrays
 * and java.util.Scanner. These classes are used to work with arrays and read
 * input from the user, respectively.
 * binarySearch Method:
 * 
 * This method is used to perform the binary search algorithm.
 * It takes two parameters: an integer array arr and an integer target that
 * represents the element to be searched in the array.
 * The method initializes two pointers, left and right, to the beginning and end
 * of the array, respectively.
 * It enters a while loop that continues as long as the left pointer is less
 * than or equal to the right pointer.
 * Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index, mid, of the current search
 * range.
 * It compares the element at the mid index with the target. If they are equal,
 * it returns the mid as the index where the target was found.
 * If the element at mid is less than the target, it updates the left pointer to
 * mid + 1 to search in the right half of the array.
 * If the element at mid is greater than the target, it updates the right
 * pointer to mid - 1 to search in the left half of the array.
 * If the element is not found within the loop, the method returns -1 to
 * indicate that the target is not present in the array.
 * main Method:
 * 
 * The main method is the entry point of the program.
 * It creates a Scanner object (sc) to read input from the user.
 * It prompts the user to enter the length of the sorted array and reads the
 * input into the len variable.
 * It creates an integer array arr with a length of len to store the sorted
 * elements.
 * It prompts the user to enter the sorted elements of the array and populates
 * the arr array with the input values.
 * It prompts the user to enter the element to search for and reads it into the
 * target variable.
 * Before performing the binary search, it sorts the arr array using the
 * Arrays.sort method to ensure it is in ascending order.
 * It calls the binarySearch method to search for the target in the sorted
 * array.
 * If the element is found (i.e., index is not -1), it prints the index where it
 * was found.
 * If the element is not found, it prints a message indicating that the element
 * was not found.
 * Finally, it closes the Scanner object to release system resources.
 * Overall, this program demonstrates the binary search algorithm by allowing
 * the user to input a sorted array and then searching for a specified element
 * within that array. It provides feedback on whether the element was found and
 * at which index if it exists in the array.
